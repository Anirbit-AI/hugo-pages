summary: "This project explores the synergy between synthetic biology and AI to overcome inherent challenges in the "Design, Build, Test, and Learn" workflow of synthetic biology. By integrating AI into manufacturing processes, the project aims to streamline, automate and optimize engineered living systems. Led by experts in both fields, the research focuses on developing automated systems for converting manufacturing tasks into lab-specific instructions. The project not only addresses current challenges in synthetic biology but also envisions an AI-assisted virtual laboratory for more efficient human-AI collaborations."

Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field applying engineering principles to the rational design of living systems. Engineering biology can offer fundamental biological insights unattainable through traditional means, and provide new-to-nature functionalities for applications in biotechnology. The synthetic biology workflow of "Design, Build, Test and Learn" (DBTL) reflects the iterative nature of engineering living systems for which genomic data is incomplete for even the simplest organisms1, and often involves trial and error due to the complex nature of living systems.
