summary: "Creating digital borders is one of the most effective ways to address the operational challenges directly related to cross-border transits at UK ports. The overarching challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of a strategic framework to support the digital transformation of borders at UK ports using AI and emerging technologies. This project will make a vital contribution to knowledge regarding the potential of AI and emerging technologies for digital borders and improve the efficiency of port operations in the UK."

Operational challenges directly related to cross-border transits at UK ports have increased dramatically in terms of both the volume and the complexity of policy-dictated interventions since the UK left the EU. These rules and the management of human staff charged with administering cross-border regulatory requirements are the main bottleneck in port operations. This is only expected to become worse with new border regulations like the Entry Exit System (EES). Specifically, the implementation of these regulations demands the devotion of increasing amounts of border staff/driver and passenger time to ensure compliance, which will automatically generate traffic congestion and queuing.
Creating digital borders is the single most meaningful way to improve ports’ efficiency yet also one of the most challenging as there are major stakeholders involved. The overarching challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of a strategic framework to support the digital transformation of borders using AI and emerging technologies. The core research of this project aims to tackle the following research questions:
- What AI and emerging technologies can potentially be adopted to facilitate the digital transformation of borders at UK ports?
- What risks and regulations need to be considered in implementing digital borders?
- How to engage with major stakeholders and support data-informed policy making for digital borders?
This project will make a vital contribution to knowledge regarding the potential of AI and emerging technologies for digital borders, and its success will not only improve the efficiency of port operations but also by extension, make UK Plc a more attractive trade partner to expand the current massive volumes of trade transiting through the Port of Dover, as the industry partner of the project.
