I am a Professor of Applied AI at the Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester. I am also the Associate Dean for Business Engagement for the Faculty of Humanities, an AI Advisor for [River Capital](https://rivercapitaluk.com/funds/river-capital-eis-ai-fund-fund-ai/) and [GuruAI](https://www.guru-ai.io), and Senior Scientist at [Eharo](https://www.eharo.com/).

My research interests are in the development and application of AI techniques (specifically optimization, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrids of these) to tackle real-world problems featuring properties such as multiple objectives, uncertainties, resourcing challenges, expensive evaluations, and privacy concerns. I have ongoing AI projects, often involving multidisciplinary teams of academics and external partners, in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, bioprocessing, private equity, data synthesis, cyber security, sports, and music.
