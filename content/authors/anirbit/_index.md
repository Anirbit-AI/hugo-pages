I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at The University of Manchester.  
I am also a member of, The Centre for A.I. Fundamentals. 
Feel free to get in touch with me at anirbit.mukherjee@manchester.ac.uk

Trying to understand deep learning and neural nets lands us into exciting new questions about differential equations and functional analysis. 
I aspire to unravel these emerging questions in mathematics. 

If you have a strong background in mathematics or statistics or theoretical physics or E.C.E. then feel free to email me about Ph.D. positions.
