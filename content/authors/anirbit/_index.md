I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at The University of Manchester. I am also a member of, [The Centre for A.I. Fundamentals](https://www.ai-fun.manchester.ac.uk/). 

I am deeply intrigued about how deep-learning and neural nets seem to land us at exciting new questions about differential equations and functional analysis. I aspire to unravel these emerging questions in mathematics.
