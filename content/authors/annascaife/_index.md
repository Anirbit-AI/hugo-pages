I am Professor of Radio Astronomy at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) and a Turing AI Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute.

My research specialises in the development of novel AI solutions for modern astrophysics, with a focus on data-intensive radio astronomy. In particular I am interested in extracting well-calibrated posterior estimates from data-driven Bayesian deep-learning models, group-equivariant deep-learning and symmetries, and learning multi-purpose representations from large volumes of unlabelled data through self-supervised approaches (foundation models).
