I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Machine Learning in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. I'm also a member of the [Manchester Centre for AI Fundamentals](https://www.idsai.manchester.ac.uk/research/centre-for-ai-fundamentals/) 

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and philosophy. In particular, my research focuses on developing probabilistic models that are aware of the amount and of the types of uncertainty they're facing, and that can react accordingly. Such models are then applied in many areas of ML and AI, such as (personalized) medicine, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. I'm also interested in the theory and philosophical aspects of imprecise probabilities.
